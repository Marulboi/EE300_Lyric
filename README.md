# EE300_Lyric
Pieces of code that I wrote during my internship, this repo is not organized, but it is here as an appendix for my report.
There are a lot of specialized functions that I am unfortunately not allowed to put on here due to my NDA, so most of these scripts will not function, but are here to show the algorithms I developed.
